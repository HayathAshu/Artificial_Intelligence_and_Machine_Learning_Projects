# AI Dual-Engine Knowledge Assistant (ChatGPT + Gemini)

This project builds an intelligent dual-response system using two leading AI models — **ChatGPT (by OpenAI)** and **Gemini (by Google)**.  
The system takes a single question from the user and generates outputs from both AI models, allowing real-time comparison of response quality, clarity, and depth.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to compare how two different AI systems answer the **same question**.  
You provide one input → The system gives:

- 🔵 **ChatGPT Response** (via OpenAI API)  
- 🟢 **Gemini Response** (via Google AI Studio API)

This helps users understand the strengths, differences, and capabilities of both AI tools.

## 🧠 Features

- Real-time query processing  
- Dual output: ChatGPT + Gemini  
- Side-by-side response comparison  
- Integration of two API providers  
- Error handling for invalid keys and API failures  
- Works smoothly on Google Colab  

---

## 📌 Technologies Used

- Python  
- OpenAI API  
- Google Gemini API  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 🔧 How to Run the Project

### **1️⃣ Install the required libraries**

pip install openai google-generativeai

### **2️⃣ Add your API keys**

Replace with your OpenAI and Gemini keys:

openai_key = "sk-proj-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
gemini_key = "AIzaSyXXXXXXXXXXXX"

### **3️⃣ Run the notebook or Python script**

The system will ask:

**Enter your question:**

## 🏁 Conclusion

Both ChatGPT and Gemini perform exceptionally well, but each excels in different areas:

### 🔵 ChatGPT (OpenAI)
- Provides clearer and more structured explanations  
- Better for coding help, debugging, and technical topics  
- Generates more human-like and detailed responses  

### 🟢 Gemini (Google)
- Strong in factual, research-style answers  
- Better at summarizing and giving Google-backed information  
- Faster for simple conceptual explanations  

### ✅ Final Verdict
- **For coding, logic, explanations, and detailed answers — ChatGPT performs better.**  
- **For factual queries, summaries, and research-oriented tasks — Gemini performs better.**

Both models complement each other, and using them together gives the most accurate and complete results.
