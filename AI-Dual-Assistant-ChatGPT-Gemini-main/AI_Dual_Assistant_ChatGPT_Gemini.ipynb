            "This is the apple/banana example. You give the machine **labeled data**—you tell it the \"right answers.\"\n",
            "*   **Examples:** Spam detection (emails are labeled \"spam\" or \"not spam\"), predicting house prices (houses are labeled with their sale price).\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 2. Unsupervised Learning (Finding Patterns on its Own)\n",
            "You give the machine a bunch of data **without any labels** and ask it to find interesting groups or patterns.\n",
            "*   **Analogy:** Imagine giving someone a box of mixed Lego bricks and saying, \"Organize these.\" They might sort them by color, by size, or by shape. They find the structure themselves.\n",
            "*   **Examples:** Grouping customers with similar shopping habits for marketing, or Netflix recommending a show because people \"like you\" also watched it.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 3. Reinforcement Learning (Learning through Trial and Error)\n",
            "The machine learns by trying to achieve a goal. It gets **rewards** for good actions and **penalties** for bad ones.\n",
            "*   **Analogy:** Training a dog. When it \"sits,\" you give it a treat (reward). When it does something wrong, you say \"no\" (penalty). Eventually, it learns to sit to get the treat.\n",
            "*   **Examples:** A computer learning to play a video game or chess, or a self-driving car learning to stay in its lane (it gets a \"reward\" for driving correctly).\n",
